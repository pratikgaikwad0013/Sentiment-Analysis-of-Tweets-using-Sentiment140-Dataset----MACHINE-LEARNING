📊 Sentiment Analysis of Tweets using Sentiment140 Dataset
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning–based sentiment analysis system that classifies tweets into Positive, Neutral, or Negative sentiments. Using the Sentiment140 dataset containing 1.6 million labeled tweets, the model learns to understand public opinion expressed on Twitter.

The project demonstrates the complete end-to-end NLP workflow, from raw text preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.

🎯 Objective

To develop an automated sentiment classification model that predicts the sentiment of tweets based on textual content using machine learning techniques.

🧠 Key Features

Cleaned and preprocessed raw tweet text (URLs, mentions, hashtags, emojis removed)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand sentiment distribution

Feature extraction using TF-IDF / Count Vectorizer

Trained and evaluated multiple ML models:

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Random Forest

Model evaluation using:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-score

Confusion Matrix

Data visualization for insights and trends

(Optional) Real-time sentiment prediction using Streamlit

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

Pandas, NumPy
